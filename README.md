--on going project--

This repository is for saving & version controllering 2019 Capstone graduation project.

Our subject is "Personalize Bus Application Service for whom taking bus to go to work everyday".
Our main speclailities are 
1. setting a repetitive bus alarm for daily routine. (sending a notification before bus arrives at the user choosen station)
2. giving a notification to let user know the time for  getting off a bus. (prevent passing away user's destination station)
3. If user wrote thinks to do in our memo section brefore, then we will give this memo when making a bus alarm notification. 
4. (keep it going...)


Currently, we only cover Kyonggi-do based bus. Not sure about expending our service to whole state of Korea.
And we are not sure about launching this app to play stroe either. 




**We're four student of Kyonggi uni's computer science dept and our team name is "foreigner".**
If you have any question or find a problem, please let us know. You will be always welcome.
