This project is offically finished. Thanks to all of team memebers for your contribution. 

***finished project***

This repository is for saving & version controllering 2019 Capstone graduation project.

Our subject is "Personalize Bus Application Service for whom taking bus to go to work everyday".
Our main speclailities are 
1. setting a repetitive bus alarm for daily routine. (sending a notification before bus arrives at the user choosen station)
2. giving a notification to let user know the time for  getting off a bus. (prevent passing away user's destination station)
3. If user wrote thinks to do in our memo section brefore, then we will give this memo when making a bus alarm notification. 



Currently, we only cover Kyonggi-do based bus. Not sure about expending our service to whole state of Korea.
And we are not sure about launching this app to play store either. 




We're four student of Kyonggi uni's computer science dept and our team name is "foreigner".
If you have any question or find a problem, please let us know. You will be always welcome.
